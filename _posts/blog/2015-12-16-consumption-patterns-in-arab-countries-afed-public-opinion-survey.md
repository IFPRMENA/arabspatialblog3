The Arab public is ready to pay more for energy and water and embrace changes in consumption patterns if this will help preserve resources and protect the environment, according to a survey carried out by Arab Forum for Environment and Development [AFED](http://www.afedonline.org/en/) in 22 countries.

However, good intentions and wishes of the public, as demonstrated in the survey results, are not enough, as putting change into action requires the introduction of appropriate enabling conditions by governments. While public awareness and education are important tools to demonstrate the benefits of sustainable consumption on human health and the environment, regulations and incentives are indispensable to transform intentions into action. Implementing energy and water conservation measures on a large scale requires revising subsidies. Renewable energy will not be deployed extensively as long as conventional fuels are sold at fraction of their real market price. Equally, phasing out subsidies needs to be accompanied by direct economic and social benefits, mainly job creation, providing education and health coverage, alongside securing appropriate income levels and pension schemes. 

A vast 84% majority of the people accept to eat more fish than red meat, which is better for the environment as well as health, the fact remains that good intentions cannot be transformed into action until fish is made available in abundant quantities and at affordable prices. 


The [AFED](http://www.afedonline.org/en/) Sustainable Consumption survey revealed acceptable levels of public awareness on environmental matters related to consumption patterns. While 72% of the respondents were aware that the Arab region was the world’s poorest in water resources, 77% knew that the level of water and energy consumption in some Arab countries is among the highest. Asked to identify the main reason behind high water and energy consumption at the household level, a majority of 46% attributed the wasteful behavior to lack of awareness. A mere 6% put the blame on subsidies, with the highest scores as compared to the regional average coming from Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait (46, 19 and 18%). This can be explained by the fact that the three countries witnessed heated debates on the issue over the past two years, with officials endorsing phasing out of subsidies. The strongest statement against subsidies came from the Omani minister of oil and gas, who declared in 2013 that “what is really destroying us right now is subsidies...we simply need to raise the price of petrol and electricity”. 

Another example showing that informed official positions help shape public opinion is that 85% of the respondents said they used energy-saving lamps, while only 45% used water-saving devices at home. This is a result of the intensive programs which made energy-saving lamps available and easily accessible in the markets, including the distribution of free energy-saving bulbs in Egypt, Morocco, Lebanon and the UAE. This was in contrast to meager marketing support for water- saving devices. 

As a follow up, participants were asked whether they were ready to pay more for water, electricity and fuel if this contributed to more sustainable use of natural resources. The question made the proposition conditional on compensating higher prices (as a result of phasing out subsidies) by offering direct benefits including higher salaries, better job opportunities, education, health and pension. 77% agreed to pay more when it came as part of a package, compared to a mere 6% who attributed the waste in water and energy use to subsidies. This presents a clear indication that people accept change as a package supported by the right enabling conditions, including appropriate incentives. 

A majority of the respondents (89%) said they were aware that Arab countries import half of the basic food products they consume, and 88% preferred locally produced food over imported food. Frequency of fast food consumption revealed uniform moderate patterns, with 61% buying fast food 1-5 times per month, and 21% not eating fast food at all. Those who buy fast food more than 6 times a month in the region amounted to 18%, compared to 24% in the GCC countries alone. 

Cost of food constituted the largest portion of the family income, compared to water and energy. 62% of respondents spent over 10% of their income on food, while only 4% of respondents spent this same proportion of their income on water and electricity. 

Changing dietary habits is a crucial issue, involving intricate social and cultural values and traditions. Dwindling water resources is likely to prevent countries from producing enough quantity of a certain traditional crop, like rice, for an ever growing population. The same applies to red meat, as raising cattle is a water-intensive activity. Moreover, cows produce a particularly high level of greenhouse gases, which intensifies climate change. Are people ready to shift to other products that are less water intensive and friendlier to the environment, such as alternative grains, fish and poultry? If the change in dietary habits would protect the environment, 84% of the respondents were ready to go for it. An astounding majority of 99% would change their habits if this would ensure their health, such as fighting obesity, diabetes and blood fats. Taking into consideration that what is better for the health is better for the environment, as most cases show, the results might indicate that a good approach to promote positive change in food consumption patterns is to put more emphasis on the health benefits, as these are more appreciated by the public. 

The main conclusion of [AFED's](http://www.afedonline.org/en/) public opinion survey on sustainable consumption patterns is that the Arab public is ready to endorse and implement profound changes in the way water, energy and food are consumed, provided that the shift is combined with appropriate enabling conditions and incentives. Alternative products and practices can only be popularized through measures that make them attainable and accessible at competitive prices.
