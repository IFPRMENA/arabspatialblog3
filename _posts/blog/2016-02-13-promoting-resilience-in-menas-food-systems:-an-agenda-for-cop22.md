This November, COP22 will be held in Marrakech. Yes, we realise it seems like COP21 only just finished – yet holding COP in Morocco is a great opportunity for discussing climate issues in the wider Arab region. 

So what issues should those of us working on food security and nutrition in MENA be raising?

We suggest the biggest single issue is to widen regional debates from their current focus on climate impacts on food production. Yes, higher temperatures, drying, and more severe droughts across MENA will affect food production. These concerns have Ministries of Agriculture from Morocco to Iran developing strategies for agricultural adaptation and reducing impacts on rural livelihoods. 

But let's put potential climate impacts on MENA's agricultural production in a broader context. To highlight just four points:

•	Climate change might reduce [yields of some crops in MENA by around 20% by mid-century](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/20595/9781464804373.pdf), but, more significantly, populations – and food demand – could double;

•	By 2050, MENA's towns and cities will have twice the population of rural areas, drastically reshaping patterns and modes of food consumption (Figure 1); 

•	Realistically, MENA's already high reliance on food imports will increase. 

•	[Poverty](http://www.arabspatial.org/blog/blog/2015/12/30/arab-region-highlights-global-poverty-and-hunger-data-challenges/), [high food prices](http://ufmsecretariat.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CIDOB-Study-The-Impact-of-Food-Price-Volatility-FINAL.pdf), and [conflict](https://ccafs.cgiar.org/blog/climate-change-food-security-and-refugee-crisis-connecting-dots-avoid-future-tragedy#.VqmOGhh96lk) are the main drivers of household food insecurity in MENA, not food production.

So resilient agricultural production is important – not least because it generates jobs and exports. Yet issues of resilient food access - chiefly the ability to pay for food - will be at least as significant. This is a key message of our recent report from the World Food Programme and the Overseas Development Institute.

So how will climate impacts affect the ability to pay for food, and what can be done about that? Poor farmers, clearly, are at risk. For them, harvest failures mean no food, and no money to buy food. Poor households and wage-earners in other sectors will be at risk from volatile food prices, the impacts of heat extremes on their ability to work and earn an income (Figure 2), and indirect climate impacts on employment opportunities because of climate stresses on the wider economy.
