The population of countries of the MENA region  was over 480 million in 2015 and is [expected to reach nearly 750 million by 2050.](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/trends/dem-comp-change.shtml). There is a steady rise in the demand for poultry meat (see Figure) and eggs [with an average annual consumption growth of 2%.](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4738e/i4738e06.pdf)  Poultry products are considered to be affordable and healthy protein sources with no religious restrictions and thus poultry meat has become MENA’s and the World’s preferred meat with the highest per capita consumption globally of all other meats. [Poultry has the best feed conversion rate for feed to human food](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-s-poultry-science-journal/article/sustainable-development-perspectives-of-poultry-production/12E3CD4C0E07BA0281B5C90ACF9B05AD) among terrestrial animals and the lowest environmental footprint in terms of energy and water use per kg of meat or eggs produced.
