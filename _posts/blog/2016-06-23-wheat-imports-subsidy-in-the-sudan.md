**1	Overview**

Wheat, a major staple cereal crop in the Sudan is targeted by numerous government policies. The most unpopular policy was the self-sufficiency policy that replaced cotton by wheat in the Gezira scheme leading among other factors to destroy the entire production system in the project (Al-Feel and AL-Basheer, 2012). The result is that the production continued to decline while consumption is in the rise (Figure 1).

The steadily increasing consumption of wheat is driven by rural-urban migration and the changes in consumption preferences of the people due to the overall wave of urbanization. Hence, wheat is turning key staple food especially in cities leaving the government with no choice other than subsidizing its more than 2.5 million metric tons of imports annually. The costs of subsidy are growing high for the already vulnerable government budget and several issues of corruption and lack of subsidy effectiveness are constantly being raised. The government is trying to reduce the imports burden by encouraging domestic production (FAO/GIEWS, 2015).

**2	The wheat subsidy**

About 2.6 million metric tons (MTs) (OECD-FAO, 2014) of subsidized wheat is imported by the three major wheat importers in the Sudan, namely, Sayga, Weeta and Seen. The imported wheat is subsidized within the government poverty alleviation strategies and the subsidy is meant to guarantee:
 
1) A fixed price for the consumer of SDG 0.33 per bread (70 grams). 
2) Supply of wheat flour to bakeries at the price of SDG 120 per 50 kg sack. 
3) Wheat subsidy is provided to the major milling companies in the form of a preferential exchange rate to import wheat grain. Companies should deposit the value of their desired amount of wheat imports in local currency to their accounts with Central Bank of Sudan (CBoS) and receive the equivalent foreign currency required for imports (Figure 2).
