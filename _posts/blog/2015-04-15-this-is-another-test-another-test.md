modeling perspective, and historical data. The impacts of floods in the Republic of Yemen are assessed using historical and projected future precipitation data.
The following sections and some of the appendices referred to in the text describe components of the modeling suite in detail. Biophysical Impact Assessment
The IMPACT climate-change-modeling system combines a biophysical model (the DSSAT crop-modeling suite) of responses of selected crops to climate, soil, and nutrients with the IFPRI Spatial Production Allocation Model dataset of crop location and management techniques (You and Wood 2006). These results are then aggregated and fed into IMPACT. Downscaling of GCMs Jones, Thornton, and Heinke (2009) used GCM simulations available from the World Climate Research Program’s (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) multimodel dataset. This dataset contains model output from 22 of the GCMs used for the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for a range of scenarios, including the three Special Report Emissions Scenarios (SRES) used in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report: AR4: A2, one family of scenarios, is a high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario; A1B, a subset of the A1 family of
scenarios, is a medium-emissions scenario; and B1, the fourth family of scenarios, is a low-emissions scenario. Model output data—including the basic core variables for many crop and pasture models such as precipitation, maximum daily temperature, and minimum air temperature—are not available for all combinations of the GCM and emissions scenarios. This severely restricted the choice of GCMs. From the CMIP3 dataset, Jones, Thornton, and Heinke (2009) used three GCMs—Centre National
de Recherches Météorologiques Coupled Model Version 3 (CNRMCM3), the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Mark 3.0 (CSIRO-Mk3.0), and MIROC 3.2 (medium resolution). They obtained maximum and minimum temperatures for the ECHam5 model from the Climate and Environmental Retrieval and Archive (CERA) database at Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ) for the three SRES scenarios. Because of data restrictions, we focused on the MIROC A1B and the CSIRO A1B for Tunisia and
the Republic of Yemen, and the MIROC A1B GCM was used for Syria. In Syria, comparisons between precipitation and daily minimum and maximum temperature projections for 2050 from 12 climate scenarios (four models, each with three emissions scenarios) show that MIROC A1B projects lower rainfall and higher temperatures than most of the other 11 scenarios. Therefore, results from
