Wakeup call

An aide enters a room in Beirut where the Minister of Agriculture is having discussion with a mission from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) on the country’s precarious agricultural extension situation. The aide silently hands over a piece of paper and leaves the room. The Minister reads the note, smiles, and shares its contents with his audience. “Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed us of complaints received from certain West European countries about chemical pesticides’ residues found on fruits, imported from Lebanon.” The smile is due to a coincidence because the mission members were sharing their field observations with the minister precisely on the same issue. That wakeup call was in 2005, about 14 years after a long civil war tore apart this beautiful country from 1975 to 1991. Apart from so much loss of life and physical infrastructure, most public institutions almost perished. One such institution was agricultural extension service, which was considered, once upon a time, as one of the best in the region, but the civil war had dissipated it to the core. 

It is a well-established fact that [food security and agricultural extension are tied to each other in a close relationship](http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/Y5061E/Y5061E00.HTM).  Beyond the obvious link to increasing food availability, agricultural extension services impact, directly or indirectly, on aspects of food access, use and stability.  FAO has an [intriguing study](http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap795e/ap795e.pdf) attempting to quantify this virtuous relationship, with its regional variations, as shown in the figure below.  Depending on the country, MENA states would need to spend up to 1% of the agricultural GDP on extension services to provide for the needs of food security and sustainable agricultural development taking while taking into consideration climate change effects.

Outsiders filling in the post-war extension gap

For Lebanon, the above FAO estimates lead to the conclusion that about [0.3% of the nation’s AgGDP should go to extension investments] (http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/nr/research-extension/img/Lebanon.pdf); and while not all extension costs are assumed to be borne by the State, there is an estimated need of about 340 extension agents.  What were Lebanon’s numbers by 2009? Less than 0.04% of AgGDP was estimated to be spent on Agricultural extension and there were just 90 extension agents (some estimates are even lower than that).  As is sadly common in post-conflict situations, three things had happened in Lebanon. First, the vacuum created by the almost complete collapse of the extension service, was rapidly filled in by a foray of mostly international non-government organizations (NGOs) --- some civil society and some religious ---, funded by different bilateral donor countries and philanthropists, which instantly sprang into action for grassroots re-habilitation and community assistance, including extension support to the Lebanese farmers, growers and producers who were suffering from a lack of technical guidance. Second, a host of private companies of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and weedicides took the struggling rural population into its grip with its own business agenda. Not only chemical products were openly promoted and sold but also there were instances where incentives were such that wrong technical advice was given by the zealous salesmen to the farmers with the sole purpose of increasing the sale of their products. As such, environmental hazards and risks to human and livestock were often ignored. And third, the farmers started demanding comprehensive extension support from the government for a variety of reasons including insufficient extension assistance by the NGOs’, exploitation by chemical inputs salesmen, and demands by the importing countries for compliance to international standards of quality of the produce. It was obvious that while the private and civil society sectors were essential partners, proper action must be taken by the government to provide the badly needed extension support --- farmers, their organizations’ representatives and exporters demanded on television channels almost on daily basis.

Government moves into action

As the hue and cry on media increased, the government took some steps to meet farmers’ demands. Approval was granted to build one extension center in each of 24 districts (caza). A few years later, the government adopted an extension strategy and created an extension coordination committee. It started contracting out the services to certain NGOs, approached the American University of Beirut for extension program development, and forged alliances between private foundations and civil society organizations. The gradual realization by the government of the importance of involving the private sector in extension services only increased with time in view of dismal public extension budget and sketchy human resources. Something greater needed to be done, the government officials realized. 


FAO assistance

In 2005, the government approached FAO for technical assistance to reform its agricultural extension services. FAO responded by launching a project under its Technical Cooperation Program, and fielding a team of international and national consultants to develop a new extension system on modern lines. The global winds of extension reforms had finally reached Lebanon. The FAO project was disrupted for almost two years by the Israeli attacks of 2006, but was continued after the hostilities stopped. 

The new extension and advisory system developed for Lebanon is: (a) pluralistic, involving public, private and civil society institutions such as government technical departments, agricultural research institutes, universities, NGOs, Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, and producer associations, in program planning and service provision; (b) decentralized to the caza level to ensure grassroots development; (c) gender sensitive, to empower rural women and vulnerable groups; (c) participatory and demand-driven, to ensure bottom-up extension program planning by village based producers’ groups, in line with their extension and training needs; (d) driven by a vision, mission and a national policy on extension, to ensure sustained political commitment to adequacy of human and financial resources for extension; (e) with a new organizational structure that has national level sections on policy and coordination, outsourcing, quality control and evaluation, and training and ICT, and also an extension program planning coordination and collaboration mechanism from the national to the village level; (f) a broad technical mandate beyond traditional technology transfer to incorporate subjects like natural resources management, food security, household nutrition, climate-smart agriculture, rural youth development etc. in the routine extension messages.    

The reformed extension system is gradually being put into place. While implementation is the key measure of success, a detailed document on the experience and lessons learnt thus far was prepared by the author at FAO request for benefiting other developing countries, and is awaiting publication.
