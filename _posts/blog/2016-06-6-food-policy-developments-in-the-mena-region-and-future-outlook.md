**Turbulent economic-political environments**

Intensified armed conflicts in the Middle East resulted in the death and displacement of millions.[According to the report]( http://www.unhcr.org.uk/about-us/key-facts-and-figures.html), the Syrian conflict alone caused a quarter million deaths, the internal displacement of 7.6 million people the migration of 4 million others. More than 6 million of global refugees now originate from the Arab region (Figure 1). The 2015 international environment also added to the intensity of the region’s economic challenges, where diminishing oil demand decreased the price of and revenues from the region’s main export, particularly for oil-rich Gulf Coopera¬tion Council countries (GCC). Oil-importing countries in turn are beginning to suffer from the resulting decrease in demand for goods and services from the GCC.
